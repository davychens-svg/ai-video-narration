- Shows equivalent FPS
- **Recommended**: 500ms (2 FPS) for SmolVLM, 2000ms (0.5 FPS) for Moondream
- Lower = faster updates but higher CPU/GPU load
- Higher = slower updates but smoother performance

**Resolution Display**
- Shows actual camera resolution being used
- Auto-adjusts based on selected video quality

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **For Real-time Use** (camera):
   - Use SmolVLM model
   - Set capture interval to 500-1000ms
   - Use Medium video quality
   - Close other heavy applications

2. **For Accurate Analysis** (video files):
   - Use Moondream model
   - Set capture interval to 2000-5000ms
   - Use Medium or High video quality
   - Process pre-recorded videos for best results

3. **For Object Detection/Tracking**:
   - Use Moondream Detection/Point modes
   - Increase capture interval to 2000-3000ms
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Stable camera position helps

### Troubleshooting

#### "Model not loaded" errors
- **Cause**: Model is still loading or switching
- **Solution**: Wait 5-10 seconds, errors will stop automatically
- **Prevention**: Don't switch models too frequently

#### No video appears
- **Camera**: Check browser permissions
- **Video file**: Ensure file format is MP4/WebM/OGG
- **Video URL**: Check CORS settings, try sample videos instead

#### Slow processing
- **Solution 1**: Increase capture interval (more ms = slower updates)
- **Solution 2**: Lower video quality
- **Solution 3**: Switch to SmolVLM for faster processing
- **Solution 4**: Close other applications

#### Empty/wrong captions
- **SmolVLM**: Make sure you entered a query (it's required!)
- **Moondream**: Wait for model to fully load (first time takes ~76 seconds)
- **Both**: Check lighting and camera focus
